.DESCRIPTION
    This function recursively scans one or more folder paths, collects access control information 
    (like who has access, permission level, and inheritance), and saves everything into a CSV.
    It also prints a quick summary to the console â€” total audited items, unique users, full control entries, 
    and any potential external access.

.EXAMPLE
    # Run with custom folders and save report to D:\Reports
    Get-AccessControlAudit -FolderPaths "D:\HR", "D:\Finance" -OutputPath "D:\Reports\HR_Audit.csv"

.NOTES
    # Make sure you run this with appropriate permissions (e.g., as an admin) to access all subfolders.
    # Helpful for security audits, compliance checks, or spotting unexpected access.
