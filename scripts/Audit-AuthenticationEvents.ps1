.DESCRIPTION
    This function searches the Windows Security log for specific Event IDs (default is 4624 for logon and 4634 for logoff),
    starting from a specified number of days ago. It captures basic details like the timestamp, event ID, and message content,
    then saves the results to a CSV file for further analysis.

.NOTES
    - Must be run with administrator privileges to access the Security event log.
    - Useful for investigations, compliance reports, or login activity reviews.
