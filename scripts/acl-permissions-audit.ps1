.SYNOPSIS
    Audits file and folder permissions (ACLs) on specified directories and exports the results to a CSV report.

.DESCRIPTION
    This function recursively scans one or more folder paths, collects access control information 
    (like who has access, permission level, and inheritance), and saves everything into a CSV.
    It also prints a quick summary to the console â€” total audited items, unique users, full control entries, 
    and any potential external access.

.PARAMETER FolderPaths
    One or more directories you'd like to audit. Defaults to:
    "C:\PatientData", "C:\Medical Records"

.PARAMETER OutputPath
    Full file path (including filename) where the CSV report should be saved.
    By default, it goes to: C:\Audit\Access_Control_<date>.csv

.EXAMPLE
    # Run with default folders and output location
    Get-AccessControlAudit

.EXAMPLE
    # Run with custom folders and save report to D:\Reports
    Get-AccessControlAudit -FolderPaths "D:\HR", "D:\Finance" -OutputPath "D:\Reports\HR_Audit.csv"

.NOTES
    - Make sure you run this with appropriate permissions (e.g., as an admin) to access all subfolders.
    - Helpful for security audits, compliance checks, or spotting unexpected access.

# Define a custom PowerShell function called "Get-AccessControlAudit"
function Get-AccessControlAudit {
    param(
        # List of folder paths you want to audit. You can add or remove paths as needed.
        [string[]]$FolderPaths = @("C:\PatientData", "C:\Medical Records"),

        # Where the final CSV report will be saved, includes today's date in the filename
        [string]$OutputPath = "C:\Audit\Access_Control_$(Get-Date -Format 'yyyyMMdd').csv"
    )
